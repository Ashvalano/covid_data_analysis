1. Data summary:
   - Check the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame using `df.shape`.
   - View the basic statistical summary of numerical columns using `df.describe()`.
   - Check the data types of each column using `df.dtypes`.
   - Identify the unique values in categorical columns using `df['column_name'].unique()`.

2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA):
   - Investigate the distribution of COVID-19 cases by age group using a bar chart or histogram.
   - Analyze the gender distribution of cases using a bar chart or pie chart.
   - Explore the temporal trends of COVID-19 cases over time using line plots or time series analysis.
   - Examine the distribution of cases across different provinces or regions using bar charts or maps.

3. Missing data analysis:
   - Identify the percentage of missing values in each column using `df.isnull().mean()`.
   - Analyze if certain columns have a higher proportion of missing values.
   - Determine appropriate strategies for handling missing data (e.g., imputation, dropping rows/columns).

4. Age and health status analysis:
   - Analyze the age distribution of COVID-19 cases using a histogram or box plot.
   - Investigate the relationship between age and health status using cross-tabulation or visualization.
   - Compare the recovery and death rates across different age groups.

5. Time-related analysis:
   - Calculate the average time to recovery or death for COVID-19 cases.
   - Analyze the trend of recovery or death rates over time using line plots or moving averages.

6. Geographic analysis:
   - Explore the distribution of cases across provinces or regions using choropleth maps.
   - Identify areas with higher COVID-19 incidence rates or hotspots.

7. Correlation analysis:
   - Investigate correlations between variables using correlation matrices or scatter plots.
   - Identify relationships between age, health status, and other variables.

8. Hypothesis testing:
   - Conduct statistical tests to compare COVID-19 outcomes based on variables such as age group, gender, or health status.
